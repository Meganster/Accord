# Accord
The pre-stable version of the program. <br/>
Implemented functional: <br/>
1. Create, update, and save playlists (right-click) <br/>
2. Adding and deleting songs, both in playlists, and in the general playback queue <br/>
3. Looping playback <br/>
4. Play pause <br/>
5. Prev next <br/>
<br/>
Need to do: <br/>
1. Random play <br/>
2. Removing playlists <br/>
3. Queuing for playback not after switching to the playlist, but after clicking on the play button <br/>
4. Incorrectly working constant pressing on prev/next <br/>
5. Redo the interface <br/>
