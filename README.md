# Accord
The pre-stable version of the program. <br/>
Implemented functional: <br/>
- Create, update, and save playlists (right-click) <br/>
- Adding and deleting songs, both in playlists, and in the general playback queue <br/>
- Looping playback <br/>
- Play pause <br/>
- Prev next <br/>
<br/>
Need to do: <br/>
1.	Random play <br/>
2.	Removing playlists <br/>
3.	Queuing for playback not after switching to the playlist, but after clicking on the play button <br/>
4.	Incorrectly working constant pressing on prev/next <br/>
5.	Redo the interface <br/>
<br/>
